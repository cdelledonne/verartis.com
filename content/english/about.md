    Ver Artis was founded by Giulia Montaperto after she moved to the
    Netherlands from Italy. Giulia loves art. Giulia knows art. Giulia enjoys
    sharing her knowledge and experience with people. That, combined with the
    sheer amount of art and museums in the Nerherlands, made it a great
    opportunity to start Ver Artis.

    Navigating art and history can be time-consuming. With our tours, we hope to
    bring you closer to the delightful artistic landscape in the Netherlands.
    Nevertheless, we know how boring a one-sided lecture can be. We try to keep
    our tours accurate but lightweight. Engagement and interactivity are our
    leitmotifs.
